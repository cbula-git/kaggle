## Coverage Scheme Analysis

### Best Man Coverage Defenses

Teams most effective when playing man-to-man coverage:

1. Seattle Seahawks (SEA) - 62.69 void score, 59.3% completion
2. Washington Commanders (WAS) - 62.81 void score, 56.8% completion
3. LA Rams (LA) - 62.81 void score, 55.7% completion
4. Green Bay Packers (GB) - 63.44 void score, 62.8% completion
5. Cincinnati Bengals (CIN) - 63.75 void score, 60.3% completion

### Best Zone Coverage Defenses

Teams most effective when playing zone coverage:

1. Cincinnati Bengals (CIN) - 51.56 void score, 74.1% completion
2. Las Vegas Raiders (LV) - 51.63 void score, 74.3% completion
3. Pittsburgh Steelers (PIT) - 51.94 void score, 68.1% completion
4. Baltimore Ravens (BAL) - 52.33 void score, 69.8% completion
5. Chicago Bears (CHI) - 52.42 void score, 71.6% completion

### Coverage Scheme Preference

**Teams that should favor ZONE coverage** (much better at zone than man):

1. **Minnesota Vikings (MIN)** - Man: 75.10, Zone: 54.57 (Δ +20.52)
2. **Jacksonville Jaguars (JAX)** - Man: 72.03, Zone: 54.38 (Δ +17.64)
3. **Baltimore Ravens (BAL)** - Man: 68.80, Zone: 52.33 (Δ +16.47)

5. **Houston Texans (HOU)** - Man: 69.08, Zone: 53.45 (Δ +15.63)

**Insight**: Interestingly, NO teams in our dataset were significantly better at man coverage than zone. All teams showed better performance with zone schemes.

## Zone-Specific Insights

### Chicago Bears - Zone Vulnerability Heatmap

**Strengths**:
- Intermediate zones: Exceptionally strong (19.7-32.1 void scores)
- Deep middle: Best in class at 65.0
- Balanced coverage across lateral positions

**Weaknesses**:
- Deep sidelines remain vulnerable (104.3 far left, 102.9 far right)
- Shallow zones slightly more exposed than intermediate

### Minnesota Vikings - Zone Vulnerability Heatmap

**Weaknesses**:
- Deep zones all highly vulnerable (92.0-101.1)
- Shallow sidelines exposed (68.3 far left, 65.5 far right)
- Relatively even weakness across all zones

**Strengths**:
- Intermediate zones better defended (19.3-32.9)
- Some competence in shallow middle/hash areas

## Key Metrics Explained

### Void Score
- **Formula**: `nearest_defender_dist × (1 / (defender_count + 0.1))`
- **Interpretation**: Higher score = more vulnerable zone
- Combines both defender proximity and zone occupancy
- Empty zones with far defenders score highest (most vulnerable)

### Target Zone Void Score
- Average void score of zones where QBs actually throw
- Lower scores indicate QBs forced to throw to well-defended zones
- Best defensive indicator of "limiting QB options"

### Zone Abandonment Rate
- Percentage of zones with 0 defenders
- **League Average**: 62.7% of zones are empty at throw time
- Higher rates can indicate aggressive coverage schemes or vulnerabilities

### Defensive Rating
- Composite metric combining:
  - Overall void score (1x weight)
  - Target zone void score (2x weight)
  - Completion rate against (1.5x weight)
  - Deep zone void score (1.5x weight)
- Lower rating = better defense
- Ranges from 4.75 (CHI - best) to 27.08 (MIN - worst)

## Strategic Recommendations

### For Offensive Coordinators

**Attacking Chicago Bears**:
- Avoid deep middle (65.0 void - their strength)
- Target deep sidelines when possible (104.3, 102.9 void scores)
- Use intermediate routes (well-covered but necessary)

**Attacking Minnesota Vikings**:
- Attack deep zones aggressively (all 90+void scores)
- Exploit shallow sidelines
- Any deep route has high success probability

**Against Zone-Heavy Teams** (BAL, PIT, LV, CHI):
- These teams excel in zone coverage
- Consider forcing them into man coverage situations
- Route combinations and pick plays more effective

**Against Man-Weak Teams** (MIN, JAX, ARI, HOU):
- These teams struggle significantly in man coverage
- Motion and personnel groupings to force man matchups
- Isolate skill players in 1-on-1 situations

## Data Quality Notes

- **Sample Size**: 14,108 plays across 272 games
- **Time Period**: 2023 NFL season
- **Analysis Phase**: "at throw" (last pre-pass frame)
- **Zone System**: 15 zones (3 depths × 5 lateral positions)
- **Out-of-bounds handling**: 3.3% of plays have OOB ball landings, assigned to nearest zone
